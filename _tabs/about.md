I’m **revolta**. By day, I play the part of a "totally normal" IT guy. By night, I live in the terminal. I spend an unhealthy amount of time dismantling binaries, pivoting through networks, and documenting the chaotic aftermath of a successful compromise.

> **RULE #1:** We don't just copy-paste commands. We understand the exploit, or we don't run it.
